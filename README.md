# User-Management-API
A HTTP JSON API developed in Go for managing users. The API supports operations such as creating a new user, retrieving a single user, retrieving all users, and editing user details. Users have attributes like ID, first name, last name, email, phone number, and an optional date of birth. This API is built using only the standard library in Go.
